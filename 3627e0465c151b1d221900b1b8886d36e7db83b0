      "message": "note: This code would probably look a lot simpler if we didn\u0027t bother with the allocation callbacks. b/201798871 pretty much concludes that it\u0027s not helpful. I think readability is more important to us for the foreseeable future. If we ever do need accurate callback usage we can probably hook new/delete and not need invasive changes.\n\nAnyway, just a note in case this or other code is easier to write without all this complexity. LGTM to keep it where it\u0027s no trouble.",
