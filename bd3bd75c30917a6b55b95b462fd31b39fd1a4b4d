      "message": "To answer your earlier question about whether it\u0027s possible to alias a symbol: yes, there are some platform-specific linker options for that. See for example https://ftp.gnu.org/old-gnu/Manuals/ld-2.9.1/html_node/ld_25.html.\n\nHowever, this is not worth the trouble. Most compilers will notice that this is calling a function with the exact same signature, and they won\u0027t push the arguments and inner function\u0027s return address onto the stack; they\u0027ll simply emit a jump to the second function. When it returns, it doesn\u0027t even come back here! So the full cost of this is one jump instruction, which is completely negligible.",
