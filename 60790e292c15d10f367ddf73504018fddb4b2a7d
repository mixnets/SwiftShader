In Vulkan, this shouldn\u0027t happen, but in OpenGL, some format conversions weren\u0027t explicitly supported in the Blitter, so we it was using the sw::Surface::read and sw::SUrface::write functions, which are extremely inefficient. We don\u0027t want to use that path in Vulkan and the Blitter should support every format.",
