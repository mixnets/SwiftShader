It\u0027s perfectly acceptable to break the build for one commit, so keeping this change separate is easier.\n\nNote that Gerrit may incorrectly labels things as Merge Conflicts: b/141099969\nAlso the Chromium bots get it wrong: http://crbug.com/1106657\nKokoro also has issues: b/141364745\n\nFortunately it can all be landed just fine with the use of Gerrit\u0027s \u0027Submit Including Parents\u0027 from the three dots menu. So just move this behind https://swiftshader-review.googlesource.com/c/SwiftShader/+/59517 and it should be okay. Thanks!",
