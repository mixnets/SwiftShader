Otherwise it would clash with anyone else\u0027s attempt to put Subzero there (as a recursive DEPS or otherwise). And since we\u0027re building a shared library, there\u0027s no desired interdependence and SwiftShader should have all its source under the same directory. You can add \"use_relative_paths \u003d True\" to the top so you can drop the \"src/third_party/swiftshader/\" part of the path.",

      "message": "The problem is that a local submodule update can overwrite the third party checkout (or vice-versa) and make it unclear that DEPS.chromium needs to be updated, rather than doing a submodule update. If both are in the same location, I can see potential weirdness happening because of that. Having the code in 2 different locations removes this potential confusion.",

If they had differences, our build output would be different depending on whether Visual Studio or GN is used for the build. So either way this is going to require vigilance on our part to keep things as intended. At least with a single location you can do a git status to see if there are changes. Anyway, I\u0027ll reach out to some chrome infra people to see if they have any strong opinions or recommendations.",
