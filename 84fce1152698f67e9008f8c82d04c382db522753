Otherwise it would clash with anyone else\u0027s attempt to put Subzero there (as a recursive DEPS or otherwise). And since we\u0027re building a shared library, there\u0027s no desired interdependence and SwiftShader should have all its source under the same directory. You can add \"use_relative_paths \u003d True\" to the top so you can drop the \"src/third_party/swiftshader/\" part of the path.",
