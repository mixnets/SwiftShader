      "message": "This is weird from an API point of view - you\u0027re only updating the map parameter only if the cache has changed from the last call to \u0027asMap\u0027. This means there is a 1:1 cache \u003c-\u003e map relationship.\n\nHow about storing the map in the struct, and returning a pointer to it? Then there\u0027s no requirement to keep the callee and caller state in sync.\n\nIf putting the map into here is not preferable, then you can use a incremental generation id (using std::atomic) so that the user knows whether the map needs to be rebuilt.",
