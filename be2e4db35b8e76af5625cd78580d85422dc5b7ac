      "message": "It\u0027s great to know the root cause for the last remaining failures, but I\u0027m not sure this is the correct fix. It seems backwards that a test would pass when increasing our advertised precision, or rather, that it would start to fail again if we lowered it. Sure, this is closer to our actual precision (for small textures), but I think it\u0027s wrong for the test to fail if we report lower precision.\n\nI\u0027ll open an issue or two with Khronos to see if we can get the spec to clarify that higher effective precision is allowed, and adjust the tests.",

      "message": "This is going to be difficult to do. The test performs linear filtering of mipmap levels, which are then interpolated based on the LOD.\nIn order to get this right, they\u0027d have to recursively retry the whole test at a progressively higher precision until it passes, and these tests are already somewhat time consuming, so we probably want to provide the test with a fairly good approximation of the precision we\u0027re using.\n\nAnyway, let\u0027s see how Khronos solves this.",

      "message": "Khronos discussion: https://gitlab.khronos.org/vulkan/vulkan/-/issues/2276\n\nI don\u0027t think dEQP would have to retry multiple times. It could compute a high-precision reference result with floating-point math, as well as a low-precision one based on the claimed \u0027minimum\u0027 precision bits. The actual result should be within the range defined by these two.\n\nTo not pessimize performance for implementations which pass with the current tests, they could first compute the low-precision reference only, check if that\u0027s fine, and if not compute the high-precision one and do the range comparison.",
