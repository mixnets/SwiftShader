      "message": "Interesting utility function! I think you can actually make the shift amounts part of its argument list too. Currently what happens is that the vector shift gets scalarized, then a new vector gets constructed with those results, then it gets decomposed into scalars again, to be OR-ed together.\n\nWhile in theory your current version could be used for non-shifted vectors as well, I think all current uses have a shift, and that\u0027s clearly what this is most useful for.\n\nWith the shift amounts as parameters we can also use a more descriptive name. \u0027PackFields\u0027 or something like that?",
