      "message": "Oh, I think the crucial part I was missing is that support for advanced blending of formats like R8G8B8A8 is *broken* without this CL. It\u0027s not just a lack of test coverage, it\u0027s that if the test coverage was provided we definitely would fail it. That\u0027s a huge difference with what I initially thought was essentially just a lack of code coverage on our end.\n\nPlease mention the Khronos bug for improving the dEQP coverage in b/203652972, so we don\u0027t lose track of that important work.\n\nI think we can move ahead with a CL like this, to unblock your work on VK_EXT_blend_operation_advanced. Note that it\u0027s a step back in performance though, since it will make us convert formats to Vectror4s and then Vector4f (and then back), instead of going straight to floating-point, but it\u0027s probably best not to conflate optimization work with necessary new features.",
