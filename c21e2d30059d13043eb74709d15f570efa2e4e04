Shouldn\u0027t we start by fixing ANGLE and the CTS to do the right thing before doing this fix in SwiftShader?

      "message": "The implementations generally implement extensions first, and then hook in support for newer Vulkan versions. Users also end up using the exts before promotions is done. So it\u0027s both commonplace for implementations to always have the ext exposed, and applications to expect to deal with extensions alone.\n\nWe could fix ANGLE and CTS, but many other apps are bound to fall into this pitfall",

We shouldn\u0027t have to do something that\u0027s not required simply because apps are using it incorrectly. ANGLE and CTS should definitely be fixed. Again, not opposed to doing this, I would just do it in a different order, fixing ANGLE and CTS first.",
