We don\u0027t really care much if the surface is RGB or BGR, since both are supported natively now, and with fast reordering of the components in case the native framebuffer has a different format.\n\nThat said, I kept the order the same in the previous patch so that the new formats get dropped as duplicates on non-Anroid. Thus no change in behavior there. That\u0027s probably worth adding as a comment on that CL...",
