Or are there other cases where the offsets wouldn\u0027t be (dynamically) uniform that aren\u0027t handled by the current code?\n\nThere might be an opportunity here to streamline this, by not representing the interpolants as a generic SIMD::Pointer, but as a regular rr::Pointer. OpAccessChain would then do the offsetting with simple scalar arithmetic.",
