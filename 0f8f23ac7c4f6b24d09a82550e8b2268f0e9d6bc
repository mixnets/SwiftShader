      "message": "This wasn\u0027t helping anything because we reproject these vertices during primitive setup by dividing by w, not z. The snapping of x and y was already commented out below. Also, w * (1.0 / w) does not always exactly produce 1.0. So a bit of numeric imprecision is unavoidable. Which is totally fine because we perform scissoring in integer coordinates now so we never risk exceeding the viewport.",
