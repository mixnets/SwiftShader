      "message": "It definitely is strange! I also expected the `: 1` to just truncate it, but apparently the standard allows the compiler to choose its own layout, so it\u0027s allowed to store the bitfield using more than 1 bit (the extras are just padding). It did this any time I tried to specify the underlying type of the enum.\n\nA non-exhaustive list of things I tried\n`enum SideEffects : \u003ctype\u003e { ... }` for various types, including `uint8_t` and even `bool`\n`unsigned enum SideEffects { ... }` (invalid syntax)\n`... { SideEffects_F \u003d 0u, SideEffects_T \u003d 1u }`\nthe `packed` attribute (suggested here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73047713, not supported by clang)\n\nI also looked for ways to try to force the bitfield declaration `  enum SideEffects HasSideEffects : 1;` to actually only use 1 bit, but couldn\u0027t find anything.\n\nUltimately I gave up and just flipped the value to -1 in the code.\n\nFixed the typo.",
