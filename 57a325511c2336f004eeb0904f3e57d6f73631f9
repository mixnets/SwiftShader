Would you please point to the context of this fix (like a bug report, test failing, etc)?\n\nAlso, unfortunately the bot that runs the CTS tests is down at the moment. We\u0027re working on fixing it, but the change cannot land until that\u0027s done. Sorry about that.",

      "message": "One of applications I work on in my spare time did not render correctly with SwiftShader, so I decided to have a look. I\u0027ve actually been meaning to start contributing to the project a few years back but only recently has my 2yo reached a point where I have a spare hour or two in the evenings. Having contributed to ES, GL \u0026 Vulkan CTS and specs for a few years, it\u0027s a nice change to actually get a chance to work on a software rasterizer!\n\nIf there are any critical bugs I could focus on, or perhaps an issue tracker I could be granted access to, I\u0027d be more than delighted to help (in a non-commited manner).",

      "message": "Thank you, I +1ed the change already since it _looks_ ok, but again, we\u0027ll have to wait for the RegressionBot to get sorted out before landing it.\n\nI have to tell you that SwiftShader is on life support, so if you want to spend your energy somewhere maybe look into lavapipe as the Vulkan software renderer? The authors had grand plans for SwiftShader before leaving, so there\u0027s no shortage of things to be done, but it doesn\u0027t look like any of that is going to happen.\n\nI occasionally implement extensions in SwiftShader while we\u0027re still testing on it, so if you\u0027re still interested in hacking away at SwiftShader, those are great additions, and the ones that don\u0027t touch SPIR-V are fairly easy in comparison too. Obviously the closer to KHR, the better 😊\n\n---\n\nWhile you\u0027re at it, please consider requesting a CTS test to be added for this bug, and I can get someone to implement it.",

      "message": "Truth be told, I\u0027m happy sticking to working with SwiftShader codebase, even if there are more powerful alternatives available out there, until the day the project flatlines. It\u0027s much thinner than Mesa and, while I have not confirmed this empirically, I suspect the latter is not as Windows developer-friendly as SwiftShader is.. 😊\n\nIf there are specific items or tickets that should not take more than a few hours to tackle, please feel free to shoot me an email with the details. Otherwise I\u0027ll just keep prodding the project\u0027s codebase and, once I get sufficiently familiar with the architecture, I might start working on some of the extensions we\u0027ve got CTS tests for.\n\nI\u0027ll see to posting a ticket with the request for a new test in Khronos CTS which would exercise this path sometime in the evening my local time.
