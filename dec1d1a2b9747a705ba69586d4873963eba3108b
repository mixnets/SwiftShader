I understand that the logic at line 1984 would need to be slightly modified, but you could complete the remaining 1 to 3 pixels with the code below (line 2015 and below), but still accelerate all previous pixels up to the highest multiple of 4 in all cases. All you need to do is have x and y declared above this code instead of within the loops and remove the else at line 2008, if I\u0027m not mistaken.",
