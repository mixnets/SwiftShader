One example is here: https://gold.skia.org/diff?test\u003dasync_rescale_and_read_rose\u0026left\u003dccb69373d0872d64f07fcc77c2aacf41\u0026right\u003ded42925bd1631a273ee1676353a828b2\n\nYou can see the full-size images:\nBefore: https://gold.skia.org/img/images/ed42925bd1631a273ee1676353a828b2.png\nAfter: https://gold.skia.org/img/images/ccb69373d0872d64f07fcc77c2aacf41.png\n\nI\u0027ve reproduced this locally as well. I can help with setting up repro, if that\u0027s useful.",
