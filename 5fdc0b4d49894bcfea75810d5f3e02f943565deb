      "message": "So I made a change, but didn\u0027t go all the way with this suggestion. I changed OffsetBindingPointer from an inheritance to a composition, which seems to work better that way and looks cleaner, but I kept it here. Most users of BindingPointer objects don\u0027t include Buffer.hpp, so I would have to add a dependency if I moved this class there. I couldn\u0027t really find a better place...",
