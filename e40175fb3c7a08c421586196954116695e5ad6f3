This bug and solution was not supposed to perform real presubmits on these - I just had 5 minutes spare after I broke the build in a way that could be caught with a small script.\n\nDon\u0027t we already have a bug open for adding the android / chrome presubmits? Yuly is already working on the latter, right?",
