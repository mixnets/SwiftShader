If we have 5 files for abstract classes and 5 platforms with concrete implementations, that\u0027s 30 files and possibly some others bunched together which are non-trivial to navigate and relate. It\u0027s neater when they\u0027re under subdirectories.",

Having to individually add files to 4+ build systems on the other hand can seriously deter people from splitting the code into more files, resulting in functionality that gets added to already bulging files and not maintaining good conceptual separation.",
