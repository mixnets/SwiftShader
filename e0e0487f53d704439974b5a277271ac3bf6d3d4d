That seems useful for readability when text follows (like this case), but for code that is commented out it might be clearer that it\u0027s not part of a clarification, without the space.\n\nUnfortunately we can\u0027t explicitly set the SpacesInLineCommentPrefix minimum to 0 as that will cause an error with older clang-format. Looks like we have no choice but to accept all these format changes.",
