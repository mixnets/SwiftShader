This is why we gather data for queries here, so a section of this function only happens once per draw call.\n\nThe idea would be to link the resolve command to the last command which modifies pixels in a renderPass. If it\u0027s a clear command, we can call resolve() after the clear, this case should be trivial. If the last command of the renderPass is a draw call, since these are the only async operations, the idea would to do it in finishRendering(), when we detect that the entire draw task is completed.",
