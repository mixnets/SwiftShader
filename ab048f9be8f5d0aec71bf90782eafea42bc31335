It\u0027s imposed on us because it makes copyright/license checking easier (debatable), but arguably things like Subzero and LLVM should be under the Reactor project folder to better match our architecture.\n\nAnyway, matching the folder structure is still far better than what we had before. :)",

Anyway, we can certainly revisit this in the future.",
