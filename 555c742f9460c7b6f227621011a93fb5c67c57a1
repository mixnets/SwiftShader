      "message": "nit: Since this inserts new and delete operator declarations, it\u0027s a bit weird not to end the statement(s) with a semicolon. That said, it\u0027s weird to have a function-style macro here as well...\n\nIt\u0027s legacy code that will be deprecated at some point, so I don\u0027t care too much either way. FWIW the equivalent ANGLE code uses just \"POOL_ALLOCATOR_NEW_DELETE\". I wonder if there\u0027s an elegant way to require adding a semicolon, without causing confusing errors when it\u0027s forgotten.\n\nProbably the most elegant solution is to eliminate the macro altogether by using the \u0027curiously recurring template pattern\u0027.",
