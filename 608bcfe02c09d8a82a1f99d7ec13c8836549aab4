I tried it locally, and got:\n\n```\namaiorano@amaiorano:~/src/SwiftShader/build$ cmake -LA -N ~/src/SwiftShader|grep CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:\nCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:FILEPATH\u003d/usr/bin/c++\n```\n\nAs you have the path to the SwiftShader checkout, you should be able to that here, and not bother generating the coverage-toolchain.txt file, right?",
