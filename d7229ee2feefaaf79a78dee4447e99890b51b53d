      "message": "I don\u0027t find it preferable. auto removes the type boiler plate, and makes refactoring types a whole lot easier.\n\nI look to the RHS of the assignment, and I can clearly see it\u0027s a pointer. If I want to see the type, I use brain, or my IDE by putting my cursor over the variable which reliably shows me the fully qualified type.\n\n\u0027auto *\u0027 is like a half-arsed type declaration. I see no point in this. Worse still, I\u0027ve seen people get confused whether we\u0027re introducing another level of indirection, leading to people actually writing C++ interview questions for this sort of thing: https://www.nextptr.com/question/a1156714788/auto-vs-auto-when-defining-a-pointer.",
