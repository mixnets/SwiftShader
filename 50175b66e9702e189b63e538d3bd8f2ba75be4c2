      "message": "Looks good but I believe Kokoro makes use of this script, and if we happen to land a change that violates the formatting we won\u0027t get notified about that again in other changes (unless you touch lines in the vicinity). Maybe that\u0027s a good thing though, and I believe a lot of repositories work this way (LLVM, for example).\n\nI don\u0027t think it would cause us to stray far from the all-formatted result, and this also makes it easier to make changes to .clang-format and let that organically affect only the files we touch next. So I\u0027m okay with this. We can always add the --all for Kokoro later if it proves useful.\n\nAlexis, any thoughts?",
