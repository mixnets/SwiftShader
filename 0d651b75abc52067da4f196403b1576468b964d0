      "message": "FYI: \"This option bypasses the pre-commit and commit-msg hooks.\"\n\nIt works around the slow clang-format problem, and also omits adding a Change-Id to the commit message. That seems okay considering that we\u0027re not supposed to manually amend these script-generated commits. Just something to be aware of in case these hooks are used for additional functionality that shouldn\u0027t be skipped.",
