      "message": "I\u0027ve looked into whether we can replace the void* with a VkClearValue or other less bug prone structure, but it\u0027s non-trivial. There are three cases to deal with: color and depth/stencil image clears, and attachment image view clears. The generic code path of the Blitter treats clears as blitting from a 1x1 image, so it just wants that pointer to the pixel. If we have three clear() methods instead, the Blitter class\u0027s interface becomes a lot more specific for Vulkan\u0027s API, while still requiring obtaining a pointer to the pixel. It\u0027s no less bug prone.\n\nWe can still follow-up later if anyone has ideas.",
