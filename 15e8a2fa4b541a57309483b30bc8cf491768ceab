I notice GitHub allows it, but it has a number of other forms that wouldn\u0027t be a good fit for us (e.g. \"Closes: X\" won\u0027t actually close anything) so I don\u0027t think we should use it for guidance.\n\nDefinitely a fan of adding \u0027Fixes:\u0027 since it indicates that it is supposed to fully fix a bug and allow it to be closed.\n\nWe can always add \u0027Fix:\u0027 later if there\u0027s stronger demand/justification for it?",
