And since this extension became an optional Vulkan 1.1 core feature with only ~20% support on Android, I think we should simply remove it instead: https://swiftshader-review.googlesource.com/c/SwiftShader/+/47408\n\nWe can look into implementing it properly when we have someone requesting support for it.",
