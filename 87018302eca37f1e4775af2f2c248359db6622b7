I\u0027ll look into how hard it is to fix, but in the meantime, I don\u0027t think this CL should be blocked.\n\nFor the sake of posterity, the build error is:\n/git/SwiftShader/third_party/benchmark/src/complexity.cc:85:10: error: variable \u0027sigma_gn\u0027 set but not used [-Werror,-Wunused-but-set-variable]\n  double sigma_gn \u003d 0.0;\n         ^\n1 error generated.\n\nSo it should be a relatively easy fix.",
