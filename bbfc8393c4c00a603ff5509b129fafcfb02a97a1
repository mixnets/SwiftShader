      "message": "note: I\u0027m thinking of assigning a (32-bit) serial ID to every entry point in the shader module instead. It would require parsing the binary for OpEntryPoint and allocating an array of IDs (or a map to immediately associate them with their names and stages). A bit inconvenient to do that at shader module creation time. Perhaps we can do it on the first vkCreate*Pipelines that uses the module since that\u0027s allowed to allocate extra memory.\n\nProbably doesn\u0027t gain us much aside from being a little less confusing about the difference between the codeSerialID passed into the SpirvShader constructor and the SpirvShader::getSerialID() return value.\n\nA struct containing both the serial ID and entry point ID might also already help in that regard.",
