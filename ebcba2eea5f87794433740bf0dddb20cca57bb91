GCC\u0027s -Wimplicit-fallthrough seems to not\nfire when the previous case contains a switch itself.\n\nThis fallthrough was bening because the helper function implementing the\ncase used dyn_cast to re-check the type of the node in question. After\nfixing the fallthrough, we can strengthen the cast.",
