      "message": "You\u0027re right, it was bug prone, and not very clear that vk::allocate/free were host memory allocations. So I made everything more explicitly named. It\u0027s a bit verbose, but considering that we \"should\" keep track of all allocations and discern between them to address b/201798871, I don\u0027t think it hurts.\n\nIdeally we should work towards having an allocator object, which knows what heap to allocate from and have a symmetrical .free() so it\u0027s more implicitly safe, but  I\u0027ll leave that for b/201798871.",
