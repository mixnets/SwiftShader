      "message": "Might just be me, but I find the implicit replicate from T to vec\u003cT\u003e here rather obfuscated, especially as the LHS is an index, which could be read as a vector-index (assigning to say vec4.x).\n\nIn terms of readability, I\u0027d personally prefer to see:\n\n  factor.blendConstant4W[0] \u003d short4(static_cast\u003cuint16_t\u003e(iround(0xFFFFu * blendConstant.r)));\n\nThis style can be forced by deleting the assignment operator for T:\n\n    // Require explicit use of replicate constructor.\n    vec\u0026 operator\u003d(T) \u003d delete;\n\nI get that this sort of undoes the implicitness you went for in 39629, which I actually quite liked.",
