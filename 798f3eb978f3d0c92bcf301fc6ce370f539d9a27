      "message": "Point of contention here: the spec only mentions to do this when oldSwapchain is VK_NULL_HANDLE. However, it does not define what should happen when oldSwapchain is a valid handle but the surface handle is wrong. Right now, I interpret it the same, and it\u0027s an easy check since retire() always disassociated the swapchain from its surface.",
