      "message": "Since we\u0027re already setting the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES as a target property for \"llvm\", and we\u0027re using target_link_libraries to link to \"llvm\", there should be no need for LLVM_INCLUDE_DIR at all. The only question I have is whether set_target_properties sets these properties as PUBLIC or not. If not, we can, instead, remove the INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES line in set_target_properties, and instead use:\n\ntarget_include_directories(llvm PUBLIC \"${LLVM_INCLUDE_DIR}\")\n\nWith this, we can avoid having to add variables to the parent scope, which is better. From what I can tell, the usage of LLVM_INCLUDE_DIR in the base CMakeLists.txt can be removed.",
