Patchset 1 (and 2) are the updates to the results after https://swiftshader-review.googlesource.com/c/SwiftShader/+/60570. While that change also included changes to the results, they appear to only be due to the dEQP revision update, not the testlist update.\n\nPatchsets 4 - 6 have a new dEQP version update included. So I suggest I manually split this so we land these separately, then run the daily again for the latest results update.",
