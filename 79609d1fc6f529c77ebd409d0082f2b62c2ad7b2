      "message": "__ANDROID__ is being used in SwiftShader to enable the Android port\u0027s features, otherwise X11 support is assumed for the Linux platform. We\u0027re trying to move SwiftShader from running inside a qemu guest to running on the host, as part of qemu. We want the Android port\u0027s features, but we might not want the logger, and we definitely don\u0027t want the cutils API (property_get, etc.).\n\nI can look into moving to liblog on the host instead, if that would be preferable, but we\u0027ll still need a way to disable unwanted parts of the Android port (when using them on the host).",

      "message": "Thanks for the clarification. Our assumption of X11 support on Linux isn\u0027t a strong one. SwiftShader will attempt to load libX11.so dynamically, but if not available it falls back to creating a \u0027headless\u0027 context.\n\nWould that work for you? It appears that a number of these android-but-not-really changes could be avoided by using a headless context, or dynamically detecting some other native display/window API.",
