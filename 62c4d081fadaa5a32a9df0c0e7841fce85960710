      "message": "This is interesting. The LLVM test run (Patchset 1) has a couple of graphicsfuzz failures, while the Subzero test run suffers from X11 contention in GLES. Ironically the former could be the result of a stack overflow due to attempting to optimize a complex shader, while the latter could be the result of running \"too fast\".\n\nThe X11 issues will go away when we\u0027ve fully removed GLES, so I don\u0027t think we need to take action on this. We have other, non-flaky failures that are worth investigating though.",
