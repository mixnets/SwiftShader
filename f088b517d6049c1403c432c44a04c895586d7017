      "message": "This won\u0027t work for larger textures. uuuu and uuu2 are really two Int2 variables (hence all the As\u003cInt2\u003e() above), so we have four 32-bit indexes as output. Admittedly these variable names are terrible and there\u0027s probably an opportunity to use real Int2 variables.\n\nThe multiplication you\u0027re doing here is 4 x 16-bit, so it will easily overflow. You\u0027ll want something much more similar to the code above. That said, this is 11 instructions while the code below is 7 instructions. I think we can just use the version below, even for NPOT textures. And for array textures you\u0027d just skip the MulHigh.",
