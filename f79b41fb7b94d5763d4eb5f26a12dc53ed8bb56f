      "message": "Seems a little bit excessive. How common do you think it is to be running regres with GCOV_PREFIX in env, along with a PROC_ID in the env value, and *not* wanting this substituted?\nI\u0027d just assume this is always true, and drop the flag.\n\nAlso - PROC_ID is a bit misleading, it\u0027s not a process id, it\u0027s a made up goroutine id. If you renamed this to REGRES_RUNNER_ID, then I think we have absolutely no reason for the flag.",

      "message": "I agree. No need for the flag. I am hoping to keep PROC_ID, as I intend to use it in other scenarios (outside of regres, i.e. GraphicsFuzz) where I just want it to represent some unique ID per parallel process; sometimes this can be a process ID (as it is currently in GraphicsFuzz), but it doesn\u0027t have to be.\n\nActually, I think one reason for having the flag was that, even though it is unlikely, the user might end up having PROC_ID in their GCOV_PREFIX without expecting it to be replaced! At least with the flag, there is some clear documentation that is hard to miss. But I think this is very unlikely!",
