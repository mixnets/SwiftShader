How common do you think it is to be running regres with GCOV_PREFIX in env, along with a PROC_ID in the env value, and *not* wanting this substituted?\nI\u0027d just assume this is always true, and drop the flag.\n\nAlso - PROC_ID is a bit misleading, it\u0027s not a process id, it\u0027s a made up goroutine id. If you renamed this to REGRES_RUNNER_ID, then I think we have absolutely no reason for the flag.",
