      "message": "uber-nit: I assume this wasn\u0027t a \"clean\" revert? When I see a title formatted like this, I would generally expect that it is.\n\nProbably just my pet peeve for reverts talking. I tend to think of most things as forward progress and a balancing of design choices. In this case, we gain the ability to call materialize() from a constructor, but regress on structure size, and we have an alternative (https://swiftshader-review.googlesource.com/c/SwiftShader/+/50828) with other tradeoffs. So talking about a \"revert\" feels slightly weird.\n\nPart of me is also still sad that we have to sacrifice structure leanness for a feature which is only used in debug builds.\n\nAnyway, I\u0027ll bite the bullet, as this is more sound C++ design and probably doesn\u0027t have real-world negative impact.
