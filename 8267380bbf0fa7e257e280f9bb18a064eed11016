      "message": "Hi again Nicolas. \n\nI had to clang-format the file I was working on inside Main as the presubmit otherwise fails. I looked a bit in clang-format-all.sh script and it did not seem to format the src folder Main - but the presubmit check did check that folder. I decided to clang format the entire folder Main in a separate commit from my patch as I thought that would make it easier to track what happens. \n\nHappy for review. \n\nHans-Filip\nVewd",
