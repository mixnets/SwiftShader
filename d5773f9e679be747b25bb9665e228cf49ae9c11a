      "message": "This is a bit confusing to me and seems convoluted. TConstParameter doesn\u0027t represent a constant parameter, but just disallows changes after construction? I don\u0027t think this is necessary. Other nodes, such as TVariable, while having protected member fields, can still be changed by set calls.\n\nInstead it might be useful to make TSymbolTable::find() return pointers to const TSymbols, and similarly make sure the TFunction interface protects the parameters from change. That doesn\u0027t have to be part of this CL.",
