      "message": "Note that while this duplicates a fair amount of code, it doesn\u0027t affect binary size in any way because we only compile the native backend. Also, we gain back back a lot thanks to specializations in the next patches, as well as a significant reduction in C++ constructs from eliminating templates.\n\nIn the end it\u0027s only 6k new lines of code: https://swiftshader-review.googlesource.com/c/SwiftShader/+/55888. For comparison, each X86 backend is about 19k lines of code, after specializations, so the combined templatized backend was massive and unwieldy.",
