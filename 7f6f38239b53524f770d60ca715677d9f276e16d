If we eliminate the print calls at compile time for non-debug builds then builds with link-time-optimization eliminate all of the string processing functionality and huge tables that it would otherwise use.\n\nInstead we can do something similar to Subzero\u0027s mandatory ALLOW_DUMP preprocessor definition (defaulting to 0). With CMake you can make it toggleable based on a cache variable or an environment variable (or both).",
