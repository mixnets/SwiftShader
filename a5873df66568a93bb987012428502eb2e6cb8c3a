      "message": "There\u0027s a risk of returning a null reference here, so at the very least there should be an assert to check for that in debug builds.\n\nAlternatively a pointer could be returned, instead of a reference. As a rule-of-thumb that means it\u0027s the caller\u0027s responsibility to check that it\u0027s non-null. However in this case we\u0027d probably like to avoid the overhead of that extra check and ensure at a higher level that it will be non-null. The assert is just to ensure that we\u0027d catch the bug in case that \"contract\" is broken in future development.\n\nWhen it\u0027s valid to have a null object but still try to access it, a reference to a default one can be provided. Is that the purpose of the placeholderTexture? Should there be one per Sampler, or a global one we only have to init once?",
