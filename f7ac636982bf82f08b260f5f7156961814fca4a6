      "message": "We currently support only EGL 1.4. Implementing 1.5 would require a non-trivial amount of additional work.\n\nHowever, we can instead implement EGL_EXT_client_extensions for all platforms. Note the code above which already implements it for Linux (with Linux-specific extensions).\n\nNote that it\u0027s an error to expect to be able to query extensions with a null display when EGL_EXT_client_extensions is not implemented or EGL \u003c\u003d 1.4. So I\u0027m curious which test expected that to work?",
