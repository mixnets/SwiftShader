I don\u0027t think it fits.\nThe base is already included in the \"descriptor\" variable. From this point, you should only be affecting offsets and the base pointer shouldn\u0027t appear anywhere else in the logic.",

      "message": "The problem I\u0027m trying to solve is that I have an unknown number of active vk::BufferDescriptor.ptr objects that I need to turn into a single SIMD::Pointer. So I need to turn 4 potential bases into 1 base + 4 offsets. \n\nSince there\u0027s no pointer arithmetic in Reactor, I convert the pointers into integers to do this.\n\nI\u0027m not sure how else to create a single SIMD::Pointer from 4 rr::Pointers. Perhaps I should solve this by changing BufferDescriptor to use base + offset? I believe all valid BufferDescriptors within a binding of the same descriptor set index into the same buffer, right?",
