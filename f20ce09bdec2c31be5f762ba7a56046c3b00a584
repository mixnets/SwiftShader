It would also make it clearer what the actual fix for dEQP-VK.texture.subgroup_lod.texelfetch is (also for the event we need to look at that again).",

While we don\u0027t have a hard limit, my general guideline is that if there\u0027s nothing \"interesting\" following (e.g. lengthy list of parameters that are obvious from the context and have no real room for error), the line can be long, but in this case it affects flow control and it\u0027s good to see all the cases for which this path is taken, without having to scroll to the right.",
