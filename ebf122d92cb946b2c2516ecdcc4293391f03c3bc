      "message": "Just FYI, this function emits a fair amount of code, so what we have here is one sequence of code for sampling an image, followed by a loop which contains essentially that same code. I\u0027m not sure if we can easily do better (certainly not as part of this CL). Perhaps a Do {} Until() loop could be used, with a sliding write window. That way we could perhaps also reuse the same result for all of the samples that share the same LOD.\n\nAnyway, just brainstorming for b/133868964. This CL is fine if it passes dEQP.",
