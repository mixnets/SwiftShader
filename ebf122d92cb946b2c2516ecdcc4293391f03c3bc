      "message": "Right, it doesn\u0027t use lodOrBias, but the dsx/dsy gradient vectors to determine LOD. So instead of checking whether the lodOrBias components are different, we\u0027d have to check the components of the latter if we wanted to optimize this in the same fashion.\n\nAnyway, since this wasn\u0027t optimized before, and it doesn\u0027t affect the next patch, this CL is fine.",

      "message": "Just FYI, this function emits a fair amount of code, so what we have here is one sequence of code for sampling an image, followed by a loop which contains essentially that same code. I\u0027m not sure if we can easily do better (certainly not as part of this CL). Perhaps a Do {} Until() loop could be used, with a sliding write window. That way we could perhaps also reuse the same result for all of the samples that share the same LOD.\n\nAnyway, just brainstorming for b/133868964. This CL is fine if it passes dEQP.",
