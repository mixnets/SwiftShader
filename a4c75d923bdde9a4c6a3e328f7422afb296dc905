That said, if an application misused this (it\u0027s not unrealistic that Chrome would use this extension whenever it detects its using SwiftShader), we wouldn\u0027t be notified about it. Also, it\u0027s not clear whether we have a validation layer checking for this, or if we\u0027d have that any time soon.\n\nLong story short, while I\u0027m not a huge fan of conditional compilation where it could be avoided, this looks appropriate for now.",
