      "message": "I\u0027m not sure that\u0027s what the spec requires. The way I interpret it, using a \"floating-point representation\" is not the same as being a floating-point format. We can choose to *represent* a fixed-point depth buffer using floating-point values, which is what we do, but in this case clamping must occur just like with a fixed-point representation.\n\nOtherwise the spec should just state that all formats require clamping.\n\nAre we currently setting PixelProcessor::depthClamp in case the original format was fixed-point?\n\nDoes my above interpretation match OpenGL test expectations?",
