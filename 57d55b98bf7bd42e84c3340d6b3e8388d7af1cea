We could be querying the cache, notice a routine is missing, generate one, and then find that the cache does contain an entry for it that was generated by another thread.\n\nCould you check if that\u0027s safe? And what about when the other thread is currently executing a routine that is going to get evicted from the cache? We reference count the renderer ones but I\u0027m not sure about the blitter.",
