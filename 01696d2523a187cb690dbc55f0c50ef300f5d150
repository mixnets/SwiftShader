Turns out, the proposed patch (https://reviews.llvm.org/D83372) isn\u0027t good enough as it will possibly break code that uses llvm_shutdown_obj to auto-invoke llvm::shutdown on destruction, depending on the order of init/destroy of different TUs. I\u0027m going to update my comment on that patch review to talk about this, but I wanted to get your opinions first.\n\nAlso, do you think we can land this as is? LSAN no longer reports leaks - at least for gpu_unittests.\n",
