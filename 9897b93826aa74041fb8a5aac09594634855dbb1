      "message": "Strategically I don\u0027t understand this change: this script shouldn\u0027t be needed with the source branch. The approach taken in this script is completely incompatible with merging to master, which is a short-term goal.\n\nTactically this could work. We\u0027d need to add this file on all on the -dev branches (jb-dev, jb-mr1-dev, jb-mr2-dev, klp-dev, lmp-dev, lmp-mr1-dev, mnc-dev, and master.\n\nI don\u0027t have the power to approve them, but bohu@google.com might.\n\nThere are some considerations: this file would appear in the AOSP release but is actually Gubuntu specific. It might be possible to put the file somewhere else where it would not appear (vendor/google/ comes to mind).",
