I do think this is better, but we may want to enable this on a per-target basis when we clean up CMake.",

      "message": "This is good, but it\u0027s unfortunate that we keep making our root CMakeLists so big. What we should do - and perhaps as part of the CMake cleanup - is move PowerVR_Examples one folder deep (/thirdparty/PowerVR_Examples/PowerVR_Examples) and add a custom CMakeLists.txt that does an add_subdirectory(./PowerVR_Examples) and all of this that you added here.",
