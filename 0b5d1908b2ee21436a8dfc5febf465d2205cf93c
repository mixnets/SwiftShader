      "message": "It seems weird to me to call ComputePitch if we also need to get bytesPerPixel. It felt like I would be double calculating stuff. And I personally have an easier time reading this code as it is now than I do when I replace that with a call to ComputePitch. It\u0027s easier to tell what this is intending to do and how it\u0027s accomplishing that when all the multiplies are kept next to each other.",
