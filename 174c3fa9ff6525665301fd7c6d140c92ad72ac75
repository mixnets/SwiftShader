      "message": "As I mentioned somewhere before, I think we should avoid the use of \"value\" to refer to any SPIR-V object. The spec doesn\u0027t use this word other than to refer to the actual bit content. Instead it uses \"Variable\" to denote something that logically lives in memory.\n\nThe only exception is when we\u0027re referring to the LLVM concept of \"value\", which is abstracted through Reactor\u0027s rr::Value.",
