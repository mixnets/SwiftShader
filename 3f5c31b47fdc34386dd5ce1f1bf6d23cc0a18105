      "message": "Our libEGL implementation needs to be able to use the Image interface, but we want to avoid pulling in all of the dependencies. In particular some image operations use dynamically generated code, and we don\u0027t want to duplicate our entire JIT engine in libEGL. It should only be in libGLESv2.\n\nSo I don\u0027t think this dependency should be added. The class dependency should be purely on virtual functions which can be called across shared libraries.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I understand what to do. The problem is that Image calls into the methods of its base class (Surface), for example unlockStencil. Are you suggesting these methods should be virtual? Would the derivation work when these virtual methods aren\u0027t implemented in the library?",

      "message": "I don\u0027t think this part of the change is required at all. Surface and Image are part of the OpenGL ES implementation, not the Vulkan implementation, and the build issue is limited to Vulkan which should be addressed entirely by the item below.\n\nRephrasing for clarity: The OpenGL ES build was not broken before https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/1615710. It only got roped into it by the dependency of swiftshader_reactor_base on swiftshader_opengl_common, which shouldn\u0027t exist in the first place and fixing that should be all that\u0027s necessary.\n\nAt least that\u0027s my theory. Let me know if it doesn\u0027t work out and I\u0027ll have another look.",
