      "message": "Our libEGL implementation needs to be able to use the Image interface, but we want to avoid pulling in all of the dependencies. In particular some image operations use dynamically generated code, and we don\u0027t want to duplicate our entire JIT engine in libEGL. It should only be in libGLESv2.\n\nSo I don\u0027t think this dependency should be added. The class dependency should be purely on virtual functions which can be called across shared libraries.",

      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I understand what to do. The problem is that Image calls into the methods of its base class (Surface), for example unlockStencil. Are you suggesting these methods should be virtual? Would the derivation work when these virtual methods aren\u0027t implemented in the library?",
