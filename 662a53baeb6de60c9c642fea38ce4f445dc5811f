      "message": "I just wanted to move it away from the top of the file since it\u0027s distracting. Note we also have eg. SamplerCore::convertSigned15() which doesn\u0027t access any class members, while others which may look similar access the \u0027state\u0027 or \u0027constants\u0027 member. So it seems a bit arbitrary to make some of them static but others not.\n\nAnyway, we can refactor these some more later if there\u0027s a marked advantage.",
