Some elements which are still be within the buffer\u0027s bounds may therefore be treated as out of bounds. This is probably exceedingly rare, which justifies cutting this corner, but I\u0027d still like to see it fixed eventually or worst case documented.\n\nPlease open a bug for it and mention it in the comment.",
