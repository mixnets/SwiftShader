So the only way I could see this occurring is if the descriptor set is referenced in a dynamically unreachable block. Is that right?\n\nIf so, it might be worth adding a TODO to emit a JIT\u0027d assert whenever we attempt to execute code that references an illegal pointer like this one. That or change the state pointer to be nullptr when the DescriptorSet has an OOB index.",
