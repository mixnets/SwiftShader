Note that memory_order_seq_cst is a very strong memory ordering, which can be costly.",

      "message": "\u003e ++refCount would default to memory_order_seq_cst, ala: https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/fetch_add\n\nAh, I see, https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/operator_arith states it\u0027s equivalent to \u0027fetch_add(1)+1\u0027, and https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/atomic/atomic/fetch_add defines that the default ordering is `memory_order_seq_cst`.\n\n\u003e I was aware of the increment/decrement operating when writing this code, but I elected for being explicit.\n\nWhile I\u0027m a big proponent of being explicit when there\u0027s something non-trivial going on behind the scenes, we haven\u0027t explicitly used fetch_add() before for these kind of cases (nor have I seen it done in other projects). Using \"++refCount\" seems more readable to me, whereas \"refCount.fetch_add(1, std::memory_order_seq_cst) + 1\" is hard to parse and leaves one wondering if something non-standard is going on.\n\nAnyway, it\u0027s just a nit at this point.",
