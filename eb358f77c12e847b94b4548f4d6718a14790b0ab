      "message": "As noted by Antonio, this splits the destructor into a separate method, which is both fragile and unnecessary. In the next Patch Set we simply invoke the Nucleus destructor at Routine acquisition. The issue of Function\u003c\u003e being destroyed without a Routine having been generated is solved elegantly by having Function\u003c\u003e own a unique_ptr to the Nucleus object. If the latter was already destroyed at Routine aquisition, it won\u0027t be destroyed again.",
