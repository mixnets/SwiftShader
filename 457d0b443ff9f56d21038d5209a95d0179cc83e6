This ends up moving the problem instead of solving it.\n\nMaybe this can work, though, did you think about just making swizzles work instead? \n\nAssuming a SIMD::Width of 8, it could make sense to have, for example:\n```\nSIMD::Float a;\na.xyzw; // Would actually mean xyzwxyzw (repeat the swizzle for each block of 4 components)\n  ```\nWDYT?",
