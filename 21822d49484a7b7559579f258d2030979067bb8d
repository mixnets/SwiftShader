While obviously this is a big feature that will see a lot of CLs, please consider splitting it into subtasks to make it a little easier to dig through the history of changes for future maintainers. For starters dicerning between between SPIR-V level and HLL level debugging could be useful, if that still makes sense at this point. Your call. Definitely could use a new bug ID after the MVP is done.",
