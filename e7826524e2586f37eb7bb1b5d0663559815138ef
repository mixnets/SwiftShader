      "message": "I\u0027ve always considered using a 64-bit value for something that should really not even come close to the limit of a 32-bit value rather wasteful. That said, I should probably research that a bit because converting variables from 32-bit to 64-bit requires sign or zero bit extension operations which could be avoided by just using 64-bit everywhere.\n\nI also think \"int\" reads a lot nicer than \"size_t\", although all the casts that are needed kind of spoil the elegance too.\n\nSo yes, I\u0027ll give using size_t some serious consideration...",

      "message": "I started changing some ints to size_t, but it quickly led to a chain reaction of changes everywhere. I\u0027m not entirely comfortable making such a big change at once just to get rid of some warnings. size_t is unsigned, so if we currently use negative values anywhere we could introduce a bug if not careful.\n\nAlso, I found out that ::size_t is only defined in cstddef.h, a C compatibility header. The C++ way is to use std::size_t, but that\u0027s 11 characters instead of 3, for very common variables. It starts looking ridiculous really fast when using std::size_t to iterate over the elements of a 4x4 matrix.\n\nI still think there are some appropriate places to be using size_t, but I think those changes should be done in small follow-up patches. This one is just meant to get rid of the warnings by explicitly doing the operations that were already implicitly taking place.",
