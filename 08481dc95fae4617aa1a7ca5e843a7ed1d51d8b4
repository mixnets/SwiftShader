      "message": "Ah yes, I temporarily disabled it to see if these errors (valid  in LLVM 7.0) also happen in LLVM 10.0. However, the build fails due to the missing config headers anyway, so this is pretty much harmless. I will probably provide a Fuchsia-specific CL to fix this later. The change here is to ensure that both the LLVM 7.0 and 10.0 are consistent in the meantime, so I\u0027d better reset it to use \"-Wno-error\". Thanks for spotting this.",
