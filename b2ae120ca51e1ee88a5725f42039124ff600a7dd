Ideally I\u0027d like to continue to use id !\u003d 0 syntax to check whether an id is valid, but that requires comparison against a raw integer, which means we\u0027d lose the static type checking advantage this class offers.\n\nThe alternative would have been an isValid() method but I find that a bit verbose and it strays away from treating this class as an integer wrapper.",
