      "message": "Whenever I see this, I know one compiler will complain about unsigned to signed conversion (size_t to int). You might want to cast stack.size() to int. Alternatively, you can use the strange but correct form that keeps i as a size_t without underflowing it in the loop body:\n\n```\nfor (size_t i \u003d stack.size(); i-- \u003e 0; )\n{\n}\n```\n\n(Just searched, and looks like it\u0027s relatively popular: https://stackoverflow.com/a/3626468)",

      "message": "You probably don\u0027t care about perf here, but std::function may allocate, so if you\u0027re willing to make this function inline, you could make it a template with a Func type, which for lambas will make it free. Hopefully, someday, we\u0027ll get a proper function_view in C++ (like https://vittorioromeo.info/Misc/fnview0.html).",
