      "message": "Nicolas has another change where he\u0027s making all the 0/1, YES/NO, to TRUE/FALSE, so may as well do it here too.\n\nHaving said that, the condition that wraps creating the ReactorLLVM target is:\n\nif(${REACTOR_BACKEND} STREQUAL \"LLVM\")\n...\nendif()\n\nand there are a couple of places that do this for Subzero:\n\nif(${REACTOR_BACKEND} STREQUAL \"Subzero\")\n...\nendif()\n\nI think since we have 2, and maybe more backends in the future, I prefer we do this kind of condition, rather than introduce a new bool variable for one backend (SWIFTSHADER_BUILD_LLVM). Otherwise, it\u0027s just inconsistent. Furthermore, I am going to be splitting up this file, and it will very much become a simple:\n\nif(${REACTOR_BACKEND} STREQUAL \"LLVM\")\n    add_subdirectory(path/to/llvm)\nelseif(${REACTOR_BACKEND} STREQUAL \"Subzero\")\n    add_subdirectory(path/to/subzero)\nendif()\n\nSo what I\u0027m suggesting is that we don\u0027t add SWIFTSHADER_BUILD_LLVM here, but rather simply replace the condition at line 588 with: if(${REACTOR_BACKEND} STREQUAL \"LLVM\")",
