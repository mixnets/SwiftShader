      "message": "This seems like it will also change the front face for stencil operations. The Vulkan spec says \"frontFace is a VkFrontFace value specifying the front-facing triangle orientation to be used for culling.\" so it looks we should only use it to modify the semantics of state.cullMode?\n\nThis might be a spec bug too, because it seems weird that frontFace would apply only to cullMode, because applications could simply switch the cull mode.",
