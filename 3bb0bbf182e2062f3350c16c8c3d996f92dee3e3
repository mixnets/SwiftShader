I find it more inconvenient, since UNIMPLEMENTED() just takes a string and doesn\u0027t enforce it has to be one of these macros. We could add a comment about that but there\u0027s still lots of room for mistakes. Also people will basically be looking up what the macro name is while they already have the spec\u0027s name in hand.",
