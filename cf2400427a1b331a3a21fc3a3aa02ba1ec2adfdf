      "message": "Thanks for contributing to SwiftShader! I think these type puns should be replaced by `sw::bit_cast\u003c\u003e` which can be found in `src/System/Math.hpp`. Once we\u0027re ready to upgrade to C++20 that could become `std::bit_cast\u003c\u003e`.\n\nI\u0027m afraid that without optimization guarantees the use of `std::memcpy()` could make certain things too slow.",
