      "message": "It is \"implementation dependent\" what happens in this case. Do we really want to return an error and draw nothing? I imagine a hardware implementation to just check if each fetch is within range, while it\u0027s already executing the draw itself. It might be worth checking the typical behavior here, as I imagine some applications will depend on that.",

      "message": "This is just checking that the actually used indices are within the start/end range passed in DrawRangeElements, right?\n\nI don\u0027t think you want to error out and fail to draw, unless the intent is a debug profile or validation implementation. DrawRangeElements is intended as a performance hint-- drivers that can obtain better performance with hints about what portions of arrays are actually used can, and other drivers suffer no penalty. I would guess that hardware implementations don\u0027t perform the check they just choose optimizations that won\u0027t explode if the application is badly behaved in reporting draw ranges.\n\nThis is a separate question from whether the referenced indices are within the bounds of the buffer itself, mind.",
