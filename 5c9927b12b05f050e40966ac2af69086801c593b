      "message": "Thank you for your contribution.\nI took a look at this, and found a few issues:\n(a) In order for this to compile, we also need to update SPIR-V Headers\n(b) Even with SPIR-V Headers updated, we get a warning-as-error about uninitialized variables (fix: https://github.com/KhronosGroup/SPIRV-Tools/pull/5501)\n(c) There was a change made to `third_party/SPIRV-Tools/utils/update_build_version.py` which was never upstreamed. I see you did some manual merging, but the general policy to to take the upstream version to avoid continued divergence and repeat merge conficts.\n\nWhen the SPIR-V Tools change lands, I\u0027ll try another import of both SPIR-V headers and tools.",
