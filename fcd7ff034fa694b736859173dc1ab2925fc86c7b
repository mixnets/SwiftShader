      "message": "As noted by Alexis, the ES 2.0 spec section 3.7.8 states that we can opt to use a value of 0.5 here to \"ensure that a minified texture does not appear “sharper” than a magnified texture\". I think that\u0027s a misleading reasoning. With MIPMAP_NEAREST, an LOD of e.g. 0.4 will be rounded to 0.0, making it sharper than when MIPMAP_LINEAR is used, but that has nothing to do with minification vs. magnification.\n\nI think a GPU manufacturer wrongly tied the filter selection to the rounded integer LOD, and then retrospectively sought a justification.\n\nUsing 0.5 as the threshold value would cause a jump between linear mipmap interpolation and using the top level. Thus I believe using 0.0 is really the preferred implementation.",
