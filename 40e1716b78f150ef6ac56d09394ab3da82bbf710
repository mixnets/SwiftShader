For unit tests and benchmarks we should never have multiple classes with the same name (that we ourselves wrote, i.e. vulkan.hpp\u0027s vk:: namespace helps clarify which are the \"native\" Vulkan types). I don\u0027t think it helps reading nor writing.\n\nLikewise the extra vkw/ subdirectory for the include files seems redundant.",
