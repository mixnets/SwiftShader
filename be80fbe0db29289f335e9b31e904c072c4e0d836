      "message": "This works fine (*) for me on my gLinux workstation, and Kokoro didn\u0027t find any issues either. The \u0027mkdir build\u0027 command now fails though, but Kokoro\u0027s script uses \u0027mkdir -p build\u0027, which doesn\u0027t complain. I can update the doc accordingly.\n\n(*) Actually I\u0027m getting warnings about \u0027-Werror\u003dunused-lambda-capture\u0027 and \u0027-s\u0027, which are treated as errors because of SPIRV-Tools\u0027 build settings. Easy to avoid by removing them from CMakeLists.txt, but I\u0027ll look into the root cause.",
