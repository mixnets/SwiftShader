      "message": "Hmm, yeah, I guess that makes sense. Ideally, this would just be a submodule, but boost doesn\u0027t really have a submodule repo (they sort of do, but mainly for developers of boost). This isn\u0027t new, though. The original change had it downloading boost into third_party/boost[version]. I suppose this is as good a time as any to remove that. The only downside is that searching in source will be more awkward when it will come to searching boost, but I suppose I can live with that.",
