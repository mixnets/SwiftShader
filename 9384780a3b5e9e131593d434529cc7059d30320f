      "message": "LLVM and Subzero both do a very good job at eliminating load operations for values which are not used afterwards. So to improve readability I think we can avoid such conditionals.\n\nWhen we do some arithmetic work which an optimizing compiler may eliminate, I do think it\u0027s worth putting some effort into avoiding it altogether, both to ensure LLVM doesn\u0027t spend too many cycles on it and Subzero doesn\u0027t miss the optimization.",
