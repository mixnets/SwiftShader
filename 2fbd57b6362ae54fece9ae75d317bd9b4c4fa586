      "message": "Approved corresponds with +2 only, Recommended is +1, while a -2 vote goes in the Rejected field, and -1 is Disliked.\n\nA change could have both positive and negative votes, in which case it would still go through testing, which is okay when there\u0027s a benign difference of opinion, or we can remove the positive vote if Regres shouldn\u0027t pick it up.\n\nThat said, I haven\u0027t actually seen this work. Will attempt to debug it next time a non-@google.com contributor\u0027s change needs regression testing.",

      "message": "Ah okay, the whole gerrit API around labelling is nuts. I suppose you could have a +1 on Presubmit-Ready and a -2 on Code-Review, and still trigger. Not that likely a problem, but might be worth explicitly setting canTest to false if codeReviewScore is negative.\n\nAnyway, ignorable. Thanks for the quick response.",
