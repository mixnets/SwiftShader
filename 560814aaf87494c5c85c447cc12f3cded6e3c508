      "message": "This still won\u0027t work properly. MulAdd() multiplies each 16-bit component of the first and second argument, then adds the pairwise results into two 32-bit integers. Note in the TEXTURE_3D case that wwww is unpacked into two Int2 vectors (wwww and www2) before MulAdd-ing each. We need the same thing here. The only difference should be that we don\u0027t need the MulHigh by the depth.\n\nThat said, I noticed that this is actually flawed when sliceP is larger than 65535. I think that on D3D9 volume textures are limited to 256^3 so that\u0027s fine, but array textures can obviously be much bigger than 256^2 and have just a few layers. Anyway, I\u0027ve filed a separate issue for that: b/26105892",
