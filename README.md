Introduction
------------

SwiftShader is a high-performance CPU-based implementation of the Vulkan graphics API<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>. Its goal is to provide hardware independence for advanced 3D graphics.

> NOTE: SwiftShader's OpenGL ES implementation is no longer supported, and will be removed. Read more about our recommendation to use [ANGLE on top of SwiftShader Vulkan here](docs/ANGLE.md) (aka. "SwANGLE").

Building
--------

SwiftShader libraries can be built for Windows, Linux, and macOS.\
Android and Chrome (OS) build environments are also supported.

* **CMake**
\
  [Install CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) for Linux, macOS, or Windows and use either [the GUI](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/) or run the following terminal commands:
  ```
  cd build
  cmake ..
  cmake --build . --parallel

  ./vk-unittests
  ```
  Tip: Set the [CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/envvar/.CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL.html#envvar:CMAKE_BUILD_PARALLEL_LEVEL) environment variable to control the level of parallelism.


* **Visual Studio**
\
  To build the Vulkan ICD library, use [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) to open the project folder and wait for it to run CMake. Open the [CMake Targets View](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019#ide-integration) in the Solution Explorer and select the vk_swiftshader project to [build](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019#building-cmake-projects) it.


Usage
-----

The SwiftShader libraries act as drop-in replacements for graphics drivers.

On Windows, most applications can be made to use SwiftShader's DLLs by placing them in the same folder as the executable. On Linux, the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable or `-rpath` linker option can be used to direct applications to search for shared libraries in the indicated directory first.

In general, Vulkan applications look for a shared library named `vulkan-1.dll` on Windows (`vulkan-1.so` on Linux). This 'loader' library then redirects API calls to the actual Installable Client Driver (ICD). SwiftShader's ICD is named `libvk_swiftshader.dll`, but it can be renamed to `vulkan-1.dll` to be loaded directly by the application. Alternatively, you can set the `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` environment variable to the path to `vk_swiftshader_icd.json` file that is generated under the build directory (e.g. `.\SwiftShader\build\Windows\vk_swiftshader_icd.json`). To learn more about how Vulkan loading works, read the [official documentation here](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Vulkan-Loader/blob/master/loader/LoaderAndLayerInterface.md).

Changes are uploaded to Gerrit by executing:

    git push origin HEAD:refs/for/master

When ready, [add](https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/intro-user.html#adding-reviewers) a project [owner](OWNERS) as a reviewer on your change.

Some tests will automatically be run against the change. Notably, [presubmit.sh](tests/presubmit.sh) verifies the change has been formatted using [clang-format 11.0.1](tests/kokoro/gcp_ubuntu/check_style.sh). Most IDEs come with clang-format support, but may require upgrading/downgrading to the [clang-format version 11.0.0](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/releases/tag/llvmorg-11.0.0) *release* version (notably Chromium's buildtools has a clang-format binary which can be an in-between revision which produces different formatting results).

Testing
-------

SwiftShader's Vulkan implementation can be tested using the [dEQP](https://github.com/KhronosGroup/VK-GL-CTS) test suite.

See [docs/dEQP.md](docs/dEQP.md) for details.

# SPIR-V Headers

This repository contains machine-readable files for the
[SPIR-V Registry](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/).
This includes:

* Header files for various languages.
* JSON files describing the grammar for the SPIR-V core instruction set
  and the extended instruction sets.
* The XML registry file.
* A tool to build the headers from the JSON grammar.

Headers are provided in the [include](include) directory, with up-to-date
headers in the `unified1` subdirectory. Older headers are provided according to
their version.

In contrast, the XML registry file has a linear history, so it is
not tied to SPIR-V specification versions.

## How is this repository updated?

When a new version or revision of the SPIR-V specification is published,
the SPIR-V Working Group will push new commits onto master, updating
the files under [include](include).

[The SPIR-V XML registry file](include/spirv/spir-v.xml)
is updated by Khronos whenever a new enum range is allocated.

Pull requests can be made to
- request allocation of new enum ranges in the XML registry file
- register a new magic number for a SPIR-V generator
- reserve specific tokens in the JSON grammar

### Registering a SPIR-V Generator Magic Number

Tools that generate SPIR-V should use a magic number in the SPIR-V to help identify the
generator.

Care should be taken to follow existing precedent in populating the details of reserved tokens.
This includes:
- keeping generator numbers in numeric order
- filling out all the existing fields

### Reserving tokens in the JSON grammar

Care should be taken to follow existing precedent in populating the details of reserved tokens.
This includes:
- pointing to what extension has more information, when possible
- keeping enumerants in numeric order
- when there are aliases, listing the preferred spelling first
- adding the statement `"version" : "None"`

## How to install the headers

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
```

Then, for example, you will have `/usr/local/include/spirv/unified1/spirv.h`

If you want to install them somewhere else, then use
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/other/path` on the first `cmake` command.

## Using the headers without installing

### Using CMake
A CMake-based project can use the headers without installing, as follows:

1. Add an `add_subdirectory` directive to include this source tree.
2. Use `${SPIRV-Headers_SOURCE_DIR}/include}` in a `target_include_directories`
   directive.
3. In your C or C++ source code use `#include` directives that explicitly mention
   the `spirv` path component.
```
#include "spirv/unified1/GLSL.std.450.h"
#include "spirv/unified1/OpenCL.std.h"
#include "spirv/unified1/spirv.hpp"
```

See also the [example](example/) subdirectory.  But since that example is
*inside* this repostory, it doesn't use and `add_subdirectory` directive.

### Using Bazel
A Bazel-based project can use the headers without installing, as follows:

1. Add SPIRV-Headers as a submodule of your project, and add a
`local_repository` to your `WORKSPACE` file. For example, if you place
SPIRV-Headers under `external/spirv-headers`, then add the following to your
`WORKSPACE` file:

```
local_repository(
    name = "spirv_headers",
    path = "external/spirv-headers",
)
```

2. Add one of the following to the `deps` attribute of your build target based
on your needs:
```
@spirv_headers//:spirv_c_headers
@spirv_headers//:spirv_cpp_headers
@spirv_headers//:spirv_cpp11_headers
```

For example:

```
cc_library(
  name = "project",
  srcs = [
    # Path to project sources
  ],
  hdrs = [
    # Path to project headers
  ],
  deps = [
    "@spirv_tools//:spirv_c_headers",
    # Other dependencies,
  ],
)
```

3. In your C or C++ source code use `#include` directives that explicitly mention
   the `spirv` path component.
```
#include "spirv/unified1/GLSL.std.450.h"
#include "spirv/unified1/OpenCL.std.h"
#include "spirv/unified1/spirv.hpp"
```

## Generating headers from the JSON grammar for the SPIR-V core instruction set

This will generally be done by Khronos, for a change to the JSON grammar.
However, the project for the tool to do this is included in this repository,
and can be used to test a PR, or even to include the results in the PR.
This is not required though.

The header-generation project is under the `tools/buildHeaders` directory.
Use CMake to build and install the project, in a `build` subdirectory (under `tools/buildHeaders`).
There is then a bash script at `bin/makeHeaders` that shows how to use the built
header-generator binary to generate the headers from the JSON grammar.
(Execute `bin/makeHeaders` from the `tools/buildHeaders` directory.)
Here's a complete example:

```
cd tools/buildHeaders
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
cd ..
./bin/makeHeaders
```

Notes:
- this generator is used in a broader context within Khronos to generate the specification,
  and that influences the languages used, for legacy reasons
- the C++ structures built may similarly include more than strictly necessary, for the same reason

## Generating C headers for extended instruction sets

The [GLSL.std.450.h](include/spirv/unified1/GLSL.std.450.h)
and [OpenCL.std.h](include/spirv/unified1/OpenCL.std.h) extended instruction set headers
are maintained manually.

The C/C++ header for each of the other extended instruction sets
is generated from the corresponding JSON grammar file.  For example, the
[OpenCLDebugInfo100.h](include/spirv/unified1/OpenCLDebugInfo100.h) header
is generated from the
[extinst.opencl.debuginfo.100.grammar.json](include/spirv/unified1/extinst.opencl.debuginfo.100.grammar.json)
grammar file.

To generate these C/C++ headers, first make sure `python3` is in your PATH, then
invoke the build script as follows:
```
cd tools/buildHeaders
python3 bin/makeExtinstHeaders.py
```

## FAQ

* *How are different versions published?*

  The multiple versions of the headers have been simplified into a
  single `unified1` view. The JSON grammar has a "version" field saying
  what version things first showed up in.

* *How do you handle the evolution of extended instruction sets?*

  Extended instruction sets evolve asynchronously from the core spec.
  Right now there is only a single version of both the GLSL and OpenCL
  headers.  So we don't yet have a problematic example to resolve.
