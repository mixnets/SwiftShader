Introduction
------------

SwiftShader is a high-performance CPU-based implementation of the OpenGL ES and Direct3D 9 graphics APIs<sup>1</sup><sup>2</sup>. Its goal is to provide hardware independence for advanced 3D graphics.

Building
--------

SwiftShader libraries can be built for Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X.  
Android and Chrome (OS) build environments are also supported.

* **Visual Studio**
  
  On Windows, open the [SwiftShader.sln](SwiftShader.sln) file using [Visual Studio Community](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/) or compatible version, and build the solution. Output DLLs will be placed in the _out_ subfolder. Sample executables such as _OGLES3ColourGrading_ can be found under the Tests solution folder and can be run from the IDE.

* **CMake**

  [Install CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) for Linux, Mac OS X, or Windows and use either [the IDE](https://cmake.org/runningcmake/) or run the following terminal commands:

      mkdir build && cd build
      cmake ..
      make --jobs=8

      ./unittests
      ./OGLES2HelloAPI

Usage
-----

The SwiftShader libraries act as drop-in replacements for graphics drivers.

On Windows, most applications can be made to use SwiftShader's DLLs by placing them in the same folder as the executable. On Linux, the LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH environment variable or -rpath linker option can be used to direct applications to search for shared libraries in the indicated directory first.

Testing
-------

See [docs/dEQP.md](docs/dEQP.md) for details.

Third-Party Dependencies
------------------------

The [third_party](third_party/) directory contains projects which originated outside of SwiftShader:

[LLVM](third_party/LLVM/) contains an outdated and diverged copy of the [LLVM](http://llvm.org/) compiler framework. Until further notice, maintenance fixes can be made directly in the SwiftShader repository.

[subzero](third_party/subzero/) contains a fork of the [Subzero](https://chromium.googlesource.com/native_client/pnacl-subzero/) project. It is part of Google Chrome's (Portable) [Native Client](https://developer.chrome.com/native-client) project. Its authoritative source is at [https://chromium.googlesource.com/native_client/pnacl-subzero/](https://chromium.googlesource.com/native_client/pnacl-subzero/). The fork was made using [git-subtree](https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/subtree/git-subtree.txt) to include all of Subzero's history, and until further notice it should **not** diverge from the upstream project. Contributions must be tested using the [README](third_party/subzero/docs/README.rst) instructions, reviewed at [https://chromium-review.googlesource.com](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/q/project:native_client%252Fpnacl-subzero), and then pulled into the SwiftShader repository.

[llvm-subzero](third_party/llvm-subzero/) contains a minimized set of LLVM dependencies of the Subzero project.

[PowerVR_SDK](third_party/PowerVR_SDK/) contains a subset of the [PowerVR Graphics Native SDK](https://github.com/powervr-graphics/Native_SDK) for running several sample applications.

[googletest](third_party/googletest/) contains the [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) project, as a Git submodule. It is used for running unit tests for Chromium, and Reactor unit tests. Run `git submodule update --init` to obtain/update the code. Any contributions should be made upstream.

# SPIR-V Headers

This repository contains machine-readable files for the
[SPIR-V Registry](https://www.khronos.org/registry/spir-v/).
This includes:

* Header files for various languages.
* JSON files describing the grammar for the SPIR-V core instruction set
  and the extended instruction sets.
* The XML registry file.
* A tool to build the headers from the JSON grammar.

Headers are provided in the [include](include) directory, with up-to-date
headers in the `unified1` subdirectory. Older headers are provided according to
their version.

In contrast, the XML registry file has a linear history, so it is
not tied to SPIR-V specification versions.

## How is this repository updated?

When a new version or revision of the SPIR-V specification is published,
the SPIR-V Working Group will push new commits onto master, updating
the files under [include](include).

The SPIR-V XML registry file is updated by Khronos whenever a new enum range is allocated.

Pull requests can be made to 
- request allocation of new enum ranges in the XML registry file
- reserve specific tokens in the JSON grammar

## How to install the headers

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build . --target install
```

Then, for example, you will have `/usr/local/include/spirv/unified1/spirv.h`

If you want to install them somewhere else, then use
`-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/other/path` on the first `cmake` command.

## Using the headers without installing

A CMake-based project can use the headers without installing, as follows:

1. Add an `add_subdirectory` directive to include this source tree.
2. Use `${SPIRV-Headers_SOURCE_DIR}/include}` in a `target_include_directories`
   directive.
3. In your C or C++ source code use `#include` directives that explicitly mention
   the `spirv` path component.
```
#include "spirv/unified1/GLSL.std.450.h"
#include "spirv/unified1/OpenCL.std.h"
#include "spirv/unified1/spirv.hpp"
```

See also the [example](example/) subdirectory.  But since that example is
*inside* this repostory, it doesn't use and `add_subdirectory` directive.

## Generating the headers from the JSON grammar

This will generally be done by Khronos, for a change to the JSON grammar.
However, the project for the tool to do this is included in this repository,
and can be used to test a PR, or even to include the results in the PR.
This is not required though.

The header-generation project is under the `tools/buildHeaders` directory.
Use CMake to build the project, in a `build` subdirectory (under `tools/buildHeaders`).
There is then a bash script at `bin/makeHeaders` that shows how to use the built
header-generator binary to generate the headers from the JSON grammar.
(Execute `bin/makeHeaders` from the `tools/buildHeaders` directory.)

Notes:
- this generator is used in a broader context within Khronos to generate the specification,
  and that influences the languages used, for legacy reasons
- the C++ structures built may similarly include more than strictly necessary, for the same reason

## FAQ

* *How are different versions published?*

  The multiple versions of the headers have been simplified into a
  single `unified1` view. The JSON grammar has a "version" field saying
  what version things first showed up in.

* *How do you handle the evolution of extended instruction sets?*

  Extended instruction sets evolve asynchronously from the core spec.
  Right now there is only a single version of both the GLSL and OpenCL
  headers.  So we don't yet have a problematic example to resolve.
