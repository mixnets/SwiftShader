Dependencies

    This extension is written against the OpenGL ES 2.0 specification.

    OpenGL ES 2.0 is required.

Overview

    This extension defines a way to request high precision texture filtering using a
    new value to Hint.

    When this extension is enabled, GL_TEXTURE_FILTERING_HINT_CHROMIUM
    can be used by the implementation as a means to distinguish between a
    performance focused implementation, using GL_FASTEST, or a precision focused
    implementation, using GL_NICEST.

    The default state of the GL_TEXTURE_FILTERING_HINT hint is
    GL_DONT_CARE and it behaves as GL_FASTEST.

New Tokens

    Accepted by the <pname> parameter of GetIntegerv, GetFloatv and
    GetBooleanv and by the <target> parameter of Hint:

    GL_TEXTURE_FILTERING_HINT_CHROMIUM      0x8AF0

New Procedures and Functions

    None.

Errors

    None.

New State
