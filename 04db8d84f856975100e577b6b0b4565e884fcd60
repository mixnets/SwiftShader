      "message": "\"from *a* typical JIT-compiler\u0027s use\"?\n\nI don\u0027t think I understand what you mean when you say \"combination of state\" here. I think what it means is the combination of sampler descriptors and sampler objects. But when the phrase \"changes in state\" comes up later, I\u0027m no longer sure what the word \"state\" is referring to anymore. Because it sounds like the two uses of \"state\" are separate.",

      "message": "Fixed to use plural posessive.\n\n\"combination of state\" is just meant generally here, as in, there are multiple state variables, and we\u0027re specializing for a specific value of each of them.\n\nI think it would sound weird if I replaced the second \"state\" with \"the combination of state\". I could drop it altogether and just leave \"changes\", but that could be interpreted too widely.\n\nI think the current sentence is a workable compromise for a first version of this file. Suggestions welcome though.",
