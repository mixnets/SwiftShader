      "message": "supporting opinion: While consistency is a strong motivation in itself, I think applying the right-to-left type parsing argument everywhere is a bit flawed because we do tend to read parts of a type as left-to-right. For example `unsigned int *` can in theory be written as `int unsigned *` but that would hurt readability since `unsigned int` is commonly read left-to-right. I think the same argument applies to `const`. Of course there are a few cases where one needs to pay attention to the right-to-left application of qualifiers and modifiers but I don\u0027t think it justifies using a less natural order elsewhere.",
