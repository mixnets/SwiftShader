This list will grow and we\u0027ll need to bind different resources based on what\u0027s used by the shader (as is already the case).\n\nAt least for shader-related tests/benchmarks we might take a page out of Amber\u0027s book on how to structure this: https://github.com/google/amber/tree/main/tests/cases. Compare that to the TriangleBenchmark constructor and renderFrame() method. Anyway, let\u0027s do things incrementally and only customize into subclasses what we need for these three cases for now.",
