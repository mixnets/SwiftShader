As a preprocessor flag that you have to change in the .cpp file (as implemented in this PS), a CMake flag, or a runtime switch (env?)?\nDepending on how they\u0027re exposed, probably alters where we should put the documentation. For example if it\u0027s a runtime flag, I\u0027d probably recommend creating a .md file.",
