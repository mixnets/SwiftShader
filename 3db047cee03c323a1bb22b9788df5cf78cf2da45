In fact, the types of values we\u0027re putting in SWIFTSHADER_COMPILE_OPTIONS and WARNINGS_AS_ERRORS really should just be set globally before adding and subfolder. These are global options, like disabling exceptions, warnings as errors, etc. This is just a stop-gap until everything has been split out.",
