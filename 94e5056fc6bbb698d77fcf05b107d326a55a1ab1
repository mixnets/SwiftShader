      "message": "For posterity: This caused Regres to use it as the build output directory, expecting vk_swiftshader.json to be in that directory as well. https://swiftshader-review.googlesource.com/40649 makes it always use build/ instead, and has some checks for ensuring the .json and .so are where they\u0027re expected to be.\n\nTotally forgot that I made copying the \"loader\" lib to out/ part of this change. O:-) Still makes sense I think, and I intent to have more build products copied in here.\n\nLet me know when you\u0027ve updated and restarted Regres, and I\u0027ll rebase this.",

      "message": "I would much prefer to avoid dumping build artifacts into the source tree.\nYes, we currently have a bit of a convention to build into `${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/build`, but it\u0027s far more hygienic to allow the build artifacts to be placed out-of-tree and have the build not touch the source tree at all.\n\nWhat I\u0027d suggest is that we copy these to `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/out`. You\u0027ll then still get your out directory, and we\u0027re keeping the git checkout clean.",
