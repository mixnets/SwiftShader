      "message": "Oh I just understood why we do this, it is because CommandPool\u0027s destructor is never called. That\u0027s unfortunate and I assume that if we use the std, what we\u0027re doing is technically UB. Can we do commandBuffers-\u003e~std::vector\u003cVkCommandBuffer\u003e(); instead?\n\nAlternatively we could reinstate the destructor as a private member of CommandPool (and protected member of Object) and call (*this)-\u003e~CommandPool();",
